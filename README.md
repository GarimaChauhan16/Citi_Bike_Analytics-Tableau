The data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.


# Here are Some of the findings:

1: The peak hours during a day is usually 7-8 AM and 5-6 PM throughout the year.

3: The major bike riders fall into the age group of 25-30 and 45-50 years of males. However the ridership among female users also seems to be increasing over time.

The peak at the age group of 45-50 years and the ridership data at the older age groups (above 80-90 years) may also indicate the input error of birth year at the user end.
